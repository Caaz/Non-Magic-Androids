# Android Tiers - No Magic Traits
This is a simple patch that disallows Androids from [Android Tiers](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1386412863) having Magic traits from [A Rimworld of Magic](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1201382956).

I've always felt robots having magic was a bit off in my game, so this was something I wanted to add as a bit of a QoL thing.

## Requirements
- Android Tiers
- A Rimworld of Magic
